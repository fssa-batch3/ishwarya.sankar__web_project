            <h4>DR.Ishwarya</h4>
          
            <p> got into Medicine against my wishes. Yes I did study hard for it, but as soon as I got into it, I felt completely out of place. I did well in my subjects, but every single year, I wanted to drop out.

                It was a terrible period for me, those days. I hardly could sustain friends, because I simply didn't belong there. I went into severe depression, had a really low self esteem and got into disastrous relationships.And the doctor's I went to, were so bad at their job that I started doubting if this career is even worth pursuing.
